   <h1>Academic Users' Information Searching on Research Topics: Characteristics of Research Tasks and Search Strategies</h1>
   <p>Jia Tina Du, Nina Evans</p>

   <h2>Abstract</h2>
   <p>This project investigated how academic users search for information on their real-life research tasks. This article presents the findings of the first of two studies. The study data were collected in the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) in Brisbane, Australia. Eleven PhD students' searching behaviors on personal research topics were observed as they interacted with information retrieval (IR) systems. The analysis of search logs uncovered the characteristics of research tasks and the corresponding search strategies.</p>

   <h2>Introduction</h2>
   <p>Information seeking is an essential part of a scholar's work. Scholars need to “find relevant information, assess the quality of the information, and use information in the research process”<a href="#1">1</a>. The collection of information is strategically important to a scholar's research work and, by nature, requires complete interaction with the information. Understanding academic users' information behavior—including both physical and online information-seeking and searching behaviors—has become an increasingly important research issue.</p>

   <p>Studies on academic users' information-seeking/searching behavior can be divided into two separate streams. One research stream has been conducted within the areas of information behavior and interactive IR. This stream was initiated by information scientists with a focus on identifying and understanding the micro-level characteristics of users' behavior. The studies within this stream have investigated information-seeking patterns of academic researchers<a href="#2">2</a>, associated affective and cognitive behaviors<a href="#3">3</a>, interactions with digital scholarly journals<a href="#4">4</a>, etc. The other stream has been conducted within the area of library service initiated by library researchers and professionals/librarians with a focus on examining the impact of macro-level users' information behavior on library information service provision and quality as well as promoting the role of libraries in the scholarly activity. For example, research on understanding how students and faculty find books<a href="#5">5</a>, how libraries can create collections and design services in order to meet academic researchers' information needs<a href="#6">6</a>, how to create user-centered information literacy instructions<a href="#7">7</a>, etc. Their discussions are more from the standpoint of library practice and rely more on indirect methodologies, such as interviews, questionnaires, and surveys. Our research aims to connect the above two streams. The research project was designed to compose of two studies. Firstly we examined the current mode of academic users' information searching behavior on research topics, and secondly we explored the role of the university library academic services in support of academic users' information searching on research topics. We believe that library professionals must fully understand the nature of users' research and information searching behavior before they would be able to provide useful and related services<a href="#8">8</a>.</p>

   <p>This article reports the findings from the first study which examined academic users' information searching behavior on research tasks when interacting with IR systems. Previous studies emphasize users' behavior but usually ignore the context in which the behavior occurs. The searching tasks provide a context for studying users' information behavior. For example, the behavior of information searching on research tasks is different from fact-finding tasks. The latter is more straightforward. Normally, the purpose of doing research is to explore something relatively new, even brand new, and to make contributions to the body of knowledge in the field. Just as research tasks are complex and challenging, so are the processes of information searching. Scholars want more sophisticated search assistances as much of the information obtained cannot be applied directly without processing into more appropriate structures<a href="#9">9</a>. The objective of the study reported in this article is to advance the understanding of information searching behaviors of academic users. The major research problem is How do academic users search for research information in an online environment? The specific research questions (RQ) to be addressed are RQ1. What are the characteristics of a research task? RQ2. What search strategies do academic users adopt for research tasks?</p>


   <h2>Literature Review</h2>
   <h3>Academic Users' Information-Seeking and Searching Behaviors</h3>
   <p>Abundant research has been done to study users' behavior as they interact with information and different types of IR system. Academic users are regarded as a significant part of user groups and their information-seeking and searching behaviors have attracted much attention in recent decades. Ellis developed models of information-seeking behavior of academics across a number of scientific disciplines: social sciences, physical sciences, and engineering sciences<a href="#10">10</a>. These studies identified six common information-seeking patterns including starting, chaining, browsing, differentiating, monitoring, and extracting. Starting comprises the activities that are characteristic of the initial search for information. Chaining refers to the activities of following chains of citations or other forms of referential connection between materials or sources identified. Browsing includes scanning not only of published journals and tables of contents but also of references and abstracts. Differentiating is the activity of using known differences between sources as a way of filtering the amount of information obtained. Monitoring refers to keeping abreast of developments in an area by regularly following particular sources. Extracting involves the activities associated with going through a particular source or sources and selectively identifying relevant material from those sources.</p>

   <p>Meho and Tibbo identified four additional behavioral features of the information-seeking process of social scientists, namely, accessing, networking, verifying, and information managing<a href="#11">11</a>. Accessing involves scholars' activities when gaining access to the materials or sources of information they identified and located. Networking is characterized by communicating and maintaining a close relationship with a broad range of people who work on similar topics or are members of organizations. Verifying is characterized by checking the accuracy of the information found. Information managing covers scholars' activities of filing, archiving, and organizing the information they collect or use in facilitating their research. For scholars, knowledge is not always immediately obtained or applied and therefore needs to be gathered, digested, organized, and stored for future use.</p>

   <p>Makri, Blandford and Cox's recent study on the information-seeking behavior of academic lawyers<a href="#12">12</a>confirmed the information-seeking behavioral characteristics originally found by Ellis and his colleagues in scientific domains. Furthermore, they identified several other behaviors such as ‘updating’ which was believed to be particularly pertinent to legal information-seeking. Jones conducted observations on eight students and an instructor working in an academic Legal Aid clinic and suggested the social nature of legal information-seeking behavior<a href="#13">13</a>. He highlighted the importance of online repositories that facilitated the sharing, annotation and tagging of documents to locate them more easily for re-use. Barrett studied information-seeking habits of graduate students in the humanities whose behaviors involved browsing, citation chasing, and constantly reading within a subject<a href="#14">14</a>.</p>

   <p>Xie observed forty library users' information-seeking strategies within an information-seeking episode<a href="#15">15</a>. The information-seeking strategies were characterized by different integration and combination of eight types of methods and six types of resources. The method related strategies included acquiring, comparing, consulting, scanning, searching, selecting, tracking, and trial and error. The resource related strategies included meta-information, part of item/specific information, whole item, a series of items/one location, one system/multiple databases, and human.</p>

   <p>The above studies provide us with insights of academic users' information-seeking patterns and searching behaviors by analyzing their searching processes. However, most of the findings are concluded from the investigations of simulated searching tasks rather than real-life research topics. Few of the information searching behavior studies shed light on the doctoral students and their searching process on research tasks. In addition, limited studies explicitly connect the characteristics of research tasks to the search strategies.</p>

   <h3>Information Sources for Scholarly Information</h3>
   <p>Electronic resources including e-books and e-journals have become the most popular format among researchers<a href="#16">16</a>. Smith explored the role of electronic journals in faculty's weekly scholarly reading habits. Survey results indicated that electronic access to journals—particularly library-funded access—is integral to research activities<a href="#17">17</a>. Kibirige and DePalo recognized six basic elements which were often required in the electronic resources that academic information seekers desired: accessibility, timeliness, readability, relevance, authority, and full-text<a href="#18">18</a>. It was found that scholars allowed the direction of their research to be influenced by full-text availability online and became dependent on the availability of full-text databases in their research and used them in some cases to the exclusion of all other information sources<a href="#19">19</a>.</p>

   <p>Millions of dollars have been invested by university libraries to purchase or develop professional full-text databases in order to improve scholars' access to high quality electronic research resources. However, studies found that Google Scholar has been embraced by students, scholars and librarians since its introduction in 2004. Howland and his colleagues<a href="#20">20</a> undertook a study to compare the scholarliness of resources discovered using Google Scholar with resources found in library databases. Their findings showed that Google Scholar was, on average, 17.6 percent more scholarly than materials found only in library databases and that there was no statistically significant difference between the scholarliness of materials found in Google Scholar across disciplines. Google Scholar includes a large portion of the citations available in library databases. On its website, Google Inc. claims that Google Scholar works with libraries to determine which journals and papers they have subscribed to electronically, and then links to articles from those sources when they are available. Local library resources can be accessed via special library links offered by Google Scholar within the search results.</p>


   <h2>Methodology</h2>

   <p>The data were collected during a previous study in the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) in Brisbane, Australia<a href="#21">21</a>. Forty-two postgraduate students who sought various types of information participated in the study. A wide range of 15 different topic areas were covered. The data mainly consisted of transcribed think-aloud utterance and search logs during the study participants' interactions with IR systems. The searches were captured and recorded by Camtasia Studio software. In addition, pre- and post-search questionnaires were administered to the study participants before and after each search separately. Follow-up interviews were conducted to allow the study participants to further clarify their behaviors and underlying thoughts. This data corpus has been used and reported in part elsewhere<a href="#22">22</a>. The present article reports the results of an analysis of a subset of these data. Eleven of the 42 study participants' search logs were selected and analyzed in order to examine the nature of academic users' information searching behavior on research tasks. The eleven study participants were doctoral students from various disciplines in pursuit of some particular research goal. The search tasks were the participatory doctoral students' own PhD thesis topics. There were no restrictions on the selection of IR systems to be interacted with. The method of search logs analysis was employed to reveal users' search strategies. Search logs recorded characteristics of actual searching behaviors of the study participants. Search logs analysis has been employed successfully in previous studies to reveal information about users' search strategies which are products of users' minds<a href="#23">23</a>.</p>

   <h2>Results</h2>
   <h3>Demographic Information of the Study Participants</h3>
   <p> <a href="https://raw.github.com/jasonpriem/sils-annotate/master/silsannotate/templates/tables/a3/a3-1.jpg">Table 1</a> shows the demographic information of the eleven study participants collected for this study.</p>

   <p>The eleven doctoral students included six (55%) female students and five (45%) male students. Most of them were in their 20s (64%) and 30s (27%). The study participants were distributed across diverse discipline areas: Engineering (N = 4), Business (N = 2), Health (N = 2), Information Technology (N = 2), and Creative Industries (N = 1). Most participants (82%) had 6 to 10 years of Web use experience.</p>

  <h3>RQ1. What Are the Characteristics of a Research Task?</h3>
   <p> The study participants' research topics were varied. The searching process and behavior may differ according to the attributes of a certain research topic. Nevertheless, in this study we were mostly concerned with common characteristics of research tasks, which were different than fact-finding tasks. A research task was defined as a search task for research-related information used for scientific purposes. A research task was more complex than a fact-based task. The success and information-seeking behavior on the research task varied from the success and behavior demonstrated on the fact-based task<a href="#24">24</a>. Based on the examinations of the eleven study participants' research topics and search logs, the following characteristics of research tasks were identified:</p>
  <h4>Explorative: The topic of a research task was relatively new in the field.</h4>
  <p>As Voorbij suggested, when academics started a new research project or had to write a paper, information was needed on a relatively new topic<a href="#25">25</a>. All the study participants believed that their thesis topics were novel/original and significant, and their research work would fill the gap in the field and hence contribute to knowledge in a particular research discipline. The nature of exploration in a research task implies that scholars' information searching was for the purpose of discovery of potential resources based on more than one trial. </p>
  <h4>Uncertain: The topic of a research task lacked certainty. </h4>
  <p>Uncertainty was closely linked to the explorative nature. Based on the limited knowledge and existing descriptions, academic users were not sure the path towards how information would be gathered and what sort of information would be useful for the research project. </p>
  <h4>Multifaceted: The topic of a research task had multiple facets. </h4>
  <p>A research topic could be divided into several sub-topics. For instance, study participant 14 performed the searching on his/her PhD thesis topic “Understanding the differences of regional Chinese consumers' behavior associated with adopting new mobile technologies.” In order to observe the differences between regional Chinese consumers in adopting new mobile technologies, he/she conducted the searching in the following three steps: (1) searching for information on Chinese consumers' mobile phone adoption behaviors, (2) searching for information on the status quo of 3G technology (new mobile technology) in the Chinese market, and (3) searching for information on consumer behaviors toward new innovation in two Chinese regional markets, namely, North and East. The research task required the study participant to recognize and understand the links between multiple phenomena and to construct “meaning” from the relevant information found via critical thinking capabilities and other analytical skills. </p>
  <h4>Logical: The topic of a research task was logical in nature. </h4>
  <p>Academic users critically analyzed and evaluated the gathered information. The sense-making process required more logic and reasoning activities. More intellectual and mental efforts were needed in order to achieve “meaningful” constructions. </p>
  <h4>Variable: The topics of research tasks varied. </h4>
  <p>Each of the study participants embarked on different research topics entailing various and specific information needs. Different from searching on fact-finding tasks, information searching on research tasks normally did not generate a common-accepted answer. Since the variations in information needs of researchers were recognized, the services of providing individual/personalized solutions were needed. University libraries could tailor their information service to the distinctive needs of individual researchers<a href="#26">26</a>. </p>
  <h4>Successive: The topic of a research task was updated at times. </h4>
  <p>In the current searches, the study participants repeated the searching on the topics which they have previously searched for as they believed that information was updated at intervals. The successive property of a research task indicates that academic users' information searching is an ongoing activity. Academic users recurrently tracked related information in order to ensure all the gathered information was updated. </p>
  <p>All the above characteristics of a research task made the academic participants' information searching processes and behaviors more complicated and difficult than searching on fact-finding tasks. The following sections present the corresponding search strategies for research tasks. </p>

  <h3>RQ2. What Search Strategies Do Academic Users Adopt for Research Tasks?</h3>
  <p>The total duration of eleven searches amounted to approximately 9 hours. Each search averaged around 40 minutes. The longest session lasted almost 1 hour while the shortest session took less than 30 minutes. The analysis of search logs identified the following types of search strategies during the academic participants' searches on research tasks.</p>
  <h4>Interaction with Multiple Search Systems</h4>
  <p>The study participants adopted the search strategy of interacting with multiple search systems when searching for information on research topics. Fourteen different types of search system were employed during the study participants' current searches, which were grouped into the following three categories:</p>
  <p>Search engines, including Google, Google Scholar, Baidu, Live Search, and Yahoo;</p>
  <p>Library online databases, including ScienceDirect, EBSCO, Engineering Village, and Wiley InterScience;</p>
  <p>Specific Websites with searching features, including AllConferences.com, Local Government Directory, Sciencedirect.com, and Wikipedia.</p>
  <p>An important strategy was the employment of multiple search systems. All the study participants except one used several search systems to search for research topics, as illustrated in <a href="https://raw.github.com/jasonpriem/sils-annotate/master/silsannotate/templates/tables/a3/a3-2.jpg">Fig.1</a>.</p>
  <p>The majority (91%) did not limit their research to one information source but use multiple search systems including both popular search engines and library online databases, with the number ranging from 2 to 6. The users gave themselves a greater opportunity to find articles that were appropriate to their research topic by using more than one source<a href="#27">27</a>. Forty-five percent of the study participants chose both Google/Google Scholar and library databases when searching on research tasks; 37 percent of the study participants only chose Google/Google Scholar; 18 percent of the study participants opted for Google/Google Scholar together with other search engines and Websites instead of using library databases. None of the study participants used library databases exclusively.</p>

  <h4>Exploration from Popular Search Engines</h4>
  <p>The study participants preferred to explore their research topics from interacting with popular search engines. Google was used most often for research information seeking—eleven doctoral students adopted Google ten times. This was a bit surprising as Google is a general search engine instead of research information convergence. Similar results were found in Barrett's study<a href="#28">28</a> where graduate students in the humanities regularly used electronic information technology and often used generic Internet search engines to find general information on a topic. The second most frequently used system was Google Scholar, which was employed seven times. QUT library online database (ScienceDirect) was used twice across the eleven searches. The rest of other search systems were only used once each. Kibirige and DePalo also concluded that there was predominant preference for search engines when searching for academic research information<a href="#29">29</a>. Academic users may use search engines on an exploratory basis when beginning a relatively new subject. In terms of reasons for selections of information sources, results show that the decisions were based not only on the particular research topic, the discipline and the level of research required to meet, but also on the accessibility, accuracy, objectivity and reliability of the information that the systems provided.</p>
  <p>The behavior of selecting entrance search systems reflects users' searching preference. <a href="https://raw.github.com/jasonpriem/sils-annotate/master/silsannotate/templates/tables/a3/a3-3.jpg">Fig.2</a> demonstrates where the study participants initiated a search for research information.</p>
  <p>The figure showed that 64 percent of the study participants used Google as a starting point for research information. As Study Participant 7 explained “It has been my habit for years.” Another 18 percent of participants listed Google Scholar as the entrance choice. Study Participant 6 believed that Google Scholar provided the “full text” link of research papers to the library databases. The remaining 18 percent of the participants used library databases as a starting point because they (e.g. Study Participant 2) insisted that more high quality research papers were offered by databases than Google and Google Scholar. In some cases, study participants started with Google just as navigation tool for locating a specific Website. For example, Study Participant 42 entered the search query “all conference” into Google in order to find a corresponding URL. His/her following search activities occurred on the Website of Allconferences.com.</p>
  <h4>Usage of Basic Search Function</h4>
  <p>The results show that most study participants (73%) preferred to use the basic search function provided either by popular search engines or by library online databases. The frequency of use of advanced search facilities was low, which only occasionally appeared in three of the eleven interactions. Study Participants 2, 7 and 13 used advanced search features in Google Scholar and library databases. All of the other participants seemed confident that they could manage on their own via constructing the complex search query with Boolean (and, or, not) and/or other operators (*, +, with, “”, ()), and entering the queries into the basic search box. For instance,</p>
  <p>“multi-channel” and “video retrieval” (Study Participant 6),</p>
  <p>query (formulation OR reformulation OR modification)(behavior or model*) (Study Participant 33),</p>
  <p>“nutrition w5 transition” (Study Participant 37).</p>
  <p>Construction of Multiple Search Queries</p>
  <p>The results show that the study participants constructed multiple search queries during the searching processes. A query is viewed as an entire string of terms submitted by a searcher in a given instance<a href="#30">30</a>.<a href="https://raw.github.com/jasonpriem/sils-annotate/master/silsannotate/templates/tables/a3/a3-4.jpg">Table 2</a> shows the number of search queries that the eleven study participants submitted to the search systems.</p>
  <p>All but one participant (Study Participant 19) constructed over 10 search queries during the current searches on their research topics, with a mean of 15 queries ranging from 4 to 26. The number was far higher than the mean of 2.3 queries per user on daily topics<a href="#31">31</a>. The findings demonstrated that academic users were involved in the much more active information searching process as evidenced in the selection of multiple search systems and an increased use of search queries. The search queries included initial query, modified query, and expanded query.</p>
  <p>Search queries were reformulated during the complex searching processes. Strategies were made to solve an information problem during which users' intellectual and cognitive activities involved, from rough understanding through problem solving and critical thinking to innovation and creativity, in order to integrate discrete even conflicting entities. By nature these strategies were query reformulations embedded within the information searching processes. The most notable strategies of query reformulations were multi-tasking, parallel, and recurrent.</p>

  <h4>Multi-tasking Reformulation</h4>
  <p>Multi-tasking reformulation was found to be a key query-formulation pattern for research information searching. Multi-tasking reformulation refers to “those sessions in which a user looks for two or more topics simultaneously in the same search session”<a href="#32">32</a>. A research topic is normally complicated and the searching cannot offer a targeted answer. As previously stated, a research task was multifaceted. One research problem was broken down into several simpler and solvable research questions. Academic users explored each sub-topic/facet in order to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the relationships embedded in the phenomenon. For example, Study Participant 14 sought to understand the differences between regional Chinese consumers' behavior of adopting new mobile technologies. He/she examined the research issue by searching on the following sub-research topics: mobile phone adoption behavior, new mobile phone technology, and regional markets/consumers.</p>
  <h4>Parallel Reformulation</h4>
  <p>Parallel reformulation was a frequent query reformulation strategy. Parallel reformulation refers to “those sessions in which a user modifies the queries from one aspect of an entity to another or from one thing to another, both of which share common characteristics” <a href="#33">33</a>. In this situation, the study participants continuously modified queries, not necessarily because of the failure of the previous query but because they needed to seek the associative and/or comparable aspects of a certain topic. For example, Study Participant 14 tried the query “Chinese consumer adoption behavior” after the search on “mobile phone Chinese consumer,” then submitted the query “China north market,” followed by “China east market;” and submitted the query “Beijing consumer,” followed by “Shanghai consumer.” Those were the instances of parallel reformulation.</p>
  <h4>Recurrent Reformulation</h4>
  <p>The strategy of recurrent reformulation was noteworthy, which refers to the cases in which a user enters exactly the same query that has already been used in two or more previous steps<a href="#34">34</a>. The study participants adhered to the same query several times because they considered the query valuable. They believed that it was necessary to make a trial of using the same query to search across several search systems because they presumed that different search systems would return distinct results. For instance, Study Participant 19 entered the query “creative cluster” firstly into Google then into Google Scholar. As he/she explained during the retrospective interview, “Google may offer me overview information of the development of creative clusters; meanwhile, Google Scholar may give me some academic papers/opinions.” Again, Study Participant 2 entered the query “evaporative cooling water air” both into a library database and Google Scholar since “I cannot find exactly topical papers in the professional database, I move to more general search engine to see what will happen there.”</p>

   <h2>Discussion</h2>
   <h3>Where do Academic Users Search for Research Information in Online Environment?</h3>
   <p>The results indicate that 45 percent of the study participants used library databases along with Google/Google Scholar, but the library databases were not used solely. Moreover, Google and/or Google Scholar were considered as the first choice for most academic information seekers (82%). Only 18 percent of the participants started their academic information searching journey from library databases. Compared to the popular search engines, the usage rate of library databases was low. Millions of dollars have been invested into the purchase/development and maintenance of professional databases by university libraries. The findings, however, demonstrate that the library databases were not used to their full potential as a primary search tool by the proposed users in universities. Why did academic users prefer Google/Google Scholar to library databases for research tasks? A couple of reasons were provided by the study participants, such as:</p>

   <p>Google/Google Scholar has stronger searching functions. (Study Participant 7)</p>
   <p>Authentic and scientific information can be found from Google Scholar. (Study Participant 19)</p>
   <p>Google Scholar is easy-to-use, and provides research papers' “full text” links to the professional databases. (Study Participants 6, 13, 32 and 33).</p>
   <p>Apparently, academic users need high quality articles in the format of full text. They used Google Scholar as they were familiar with the interface which was “easy to use.” More importantly, Google Scholar brings users into contact with resources including full-text and high-quality articles provided by libraries. Google Scholar cooperates with the database vendors and publishers, which makes Google Scholar a successful discovery tool for finding scholarly information<a href="#35">35</a>. Libraries may provide quality information resources in response to users' information searching by providing an interface that is familiar to users.</p>

   <h3>Characteristics of Research Tasks and Certain Search Strategies</h3>
   <p><a href="https://raw.github.com/jasonpriem/sils-annotate/master/silsannotate/templates/tables/a3/a3-5.jpg">Fig.3</a> illustrates the matching between characteristics of research tasks and the corresponding search strategies.</p>

   <p>Due to a research task's explorative and uncertain attributes, academic users follow a trial and error strategy by exploring the information from search engines and interacting with multiple search systems. The selection of search systems also varies between different research topics. The multifaceted and logical attributes of a research topic determine that scholars normally break down a complex/large problem into several simpler/smaller questions, then identify the links between the questions, and construct and synthesize “meaning” from the retrieved relevant information through assembling multiple search queries and applying multi-tasking reformulation and parallel reformulation techniques. Academic users dedicate themselves to active information searching by an increasing use of multiple search systems and multiple search queries. Successive searching and obtaining updated information are required for research activities. Recurrent reformulation is an important and useful technique for continuing information collection.</p>

   <h3>How to Support Academic Users' Research Activities under End-user Searching Context</h3>
   <p>End-user searching, to some extent, alienates librarians from users. The relationship between academics and librarians, especially reference librarians, under end-user searching context is not as close as prior mediated IR interaction. The nature of research tasks identified in this study increases the complexity of information searching processes and the difficulty of attaining comprehensive information. As realized, academic users IR interaction is not without difficulty. Looking for useful and high-quality information might become a mental burden to academics. For one thing, the examining of information searching strategies for research topics shows that the academic users did not resort to librarians to locate and find information. The only library-related service they used was accessing the library-fund databases. For another, University libraries claim that they are developing research-oriented service mechanisms and providing user-centered and individualized academic information service. A gap may exist between users' perceptions and the library's provisions in terms of academic information services support. How the university library academic information services play a more active role in the mediation of information by changing from providers of access, to information to participants of interaction with information and innovation, still remains a strategic issue and deserves further attention.</p>

   <p>Information searching on research tasks involves huge mental processing on users' behalf. The academic users' search strategies identified in this study—multiple search systems, multiple search queries, query reformulation, and entailed intellectual activities including breaking down, linking and synthesizing—call for some enhancements in the design of existing IR systems. The new search technology may be designed to assist users in devising different search queries at different stages of their information searching process. Many search systems do have a “searches related to” feature, but it is a different function from the support which is needed for multi-tasking or parallel reformulation strategies. An IR system may also optimize its interface by providing tools for tagging, categorizing, and annotating search results, as well as storing relevant information for further use. That would simplify the processing of collected information and facilitate continuing or successive searches.</p>

   <h2>Conclusions</h2>
   <p>This study observed eleven academic users' information searching behavior within research-task searching scenarios in the online environment. Academic users' searching behavior was measured by adoption of multiple search systems, construction of multiple search queries, use of basic search function, and query reformulations. The results provide new knowledge of academic users' perceptions concerning research-based tasks and enhance our understanding of real-life information searching and user behavior in a research environment. But the study limits its findings to users' interactions with IR systems. A further study may work on a broader picture of exploring and modeling common patterns and stages of academic users' searching behavior embedded within their research process.</p>
