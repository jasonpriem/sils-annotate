<p class="calibre20"><span class="calibre21"><span class="calibre11">Abstract</span></span></p><p class="calibre18"><span class="calibre3">The ways in which the temporal context of information seeking has been approached in the information-seeking literature are explored. Three major approaches were identified: (i) time as a fundamental attribute of situation or context of information seeking, (ii) time as qualifier of access to information, and (iii) time as an indicator of the information-seeking process. Temporal factors qualify situations and contexts of information seeking by expresssions such as dynamic, reiterative, and project. These factors can also be referred to as qualifiers of accessibility in the sense of constraints within which information may be accessed particularly in hurry situations. Temporal factors also qualify information seeking as a process from the viewpoint of stages or cycles. Recently, cyclic and non-linear models challenge the stage models of information seeking by emphasizing the contingency of information-seeking processes.</span></p><a></a><hr class="calibre19"/><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_2"></div>

<p class="calibre20"><span class="calibre21"><span class="calibre11">1. Introduction</span></span></p><p class="calibre18"><span class="calibre3">Time is one of the main contextual factors of information seeking. With the growing popularity of the networked sources, temporal issues have come to the fore more strongly than previously. This is understandable because the Internet epitomizes instant access to information and overcoming of spatial and temporal barriers of information seeking. In general, temporal factors refer to questions such as “How long does it take to identify and access information sources and channels?” In empirical surveys on information needs and seeking, typical issues dealing with temporal factors concern the frequency or regularity of accessing and using different kinds of information sources. Temporal issues are also involved when exploring the ways in which information needs and relevance judgments change as the information-seeking process evolves.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre3">Even though the research literature abounds in expressions implying temporal contexts, for example, “anticipated information needs” (</span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos68779"><span class="calibre3">Bruce, 2005</span></a><span class="calibre3">) and “multiple information-seeking episodes” (</span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos114979"><span class="calibre3">Lin &amp; Belkin, 2000</span></a><span class="calibre3">), the conceptual issues of temporal factors have rarely been discussed in information studies. </span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos134895"><span class="calibre3">Sonnenwald and Iivonen (1999, p. 436)</span></a><span class="calibre3"> suggest that time is the non-spatial continuum in which actions and events occur. They identified three temporal aspects of information behavior, that is, an </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">episode</span></span><span class="calibre3"> (short period of time), an </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">interval</span></span><span class="calibre3"> (longer period of time with a distinct starting and ending), and an </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">eon</span></span><span class="calibre3"> (a long, continuous period of time). Another example is provided by </span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos136236"><span class="calibre3">Spink, Wilson, Ford, Foster, and Ellis (2002)</span></a><span class="calibre3"> explicitly referring to interactive episodes and time as factors of information retrieval and human information behavior. However, these authors did not reflect the conceptual nature of temporal factors in greater detail.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre3">The dearth of conceptual analyses may be due to the ambiguity of temporal factors; questions such as “what is ultimately meant by time” lead to complicated problems of fundamental ontology as evidenced by </span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos103134"><span class="calibre3">Heidegger (1978)</span></a><span class="calibre3">. One of the problems of defining temporal factors is that they tend to be “everywhere” because time is embedded in all human action. Naturally, we may think of it the other way round: all human action is embedded in time. In information studies, the thematization of temporal context is also rendered difficult by the fact that temporal and spatial factors tend to be discussed together, as exemplified by phrases such as “time-space context” of information needs, seeking and use. A further difficulty lies in the fact that temporal factors remain implicit in many models of information seeking. For example, </span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos111048"><span class="calibre3">Kuhlthau's (1993)</span></a><span class="calibre3"> Information Search Model does not elaborate the role of temporal factors, even though the model suggests that information-seeking progresses in time through six major stages, even though not necessarily in a linear way.</span></p><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_3"></div>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre21"><span class="calibre11">2. Research setting</span></span></p><p class="calibre18"><span class="calibre3">The present study addresses the following research questions:</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre3"> •  </span></p><blockquote class="calibre22"><blockquote class="calibre23"><span class="calibre3">In which ways has the temporal context been conceptualized in information-seeking studies? </span></blockquote><a></a></blockquote><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre3"> •  </span></p><blockquote class="calibre22"><blockquote class="calibre23"><span class="calibre3">What are the major approaches to temporal factors forming this context, and what kind of temporal contexts of information seeking do these approaches suggest? </span></blockquote><a></a></blockquote><p class="calibre20"><span class="calibre3">To answer the above questions, a considerable number of studies, both conceptual and empirical studies were investigated by means of conceptual analysis. At the initial stage of the study, the major criterion used in the selection of the research literature was simply the topic, that is, the temporal factors of information seeking. After the initial reading, studies explicitly discussing these factors were preferred, and they were analyzed in more detail. The studies ranged from descriptions of general models of information seeking to empirical surveys of everyday life information seeking (ELIS). The total number of articles and books analyzed for the study amounted to about 100. This appeared to be a sufficient number to capture the variety of conceptions. Due to research economy, the main attention was paid to the ELIS studies. For the same reason, studies published in the 1990s and later were preferred. The main attention was focused on studies discussing information seeking on the level of source selection and use.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre3">Because temporal factors are associated with a number of issues relevant to information studies, some limitations to the study are inevitable due to space restrictions alone. First, studies focusing on the ways in which information search tactics change over time in database searching were omitted (a recent example of studies of these kinds is provided by </span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos142998"><span class="calibre3">Wildemuth, 2004</span></a><span class="calibre3">). Second, closely related to the above specification, the issues dealing with learning during the information searching process were excluded (these issues have been discussed, for example, by </span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos140835"><span class="calibre3">Vakkari &amp; Hakala, 2000</span></a><span class="calibre3">). Third, no attention was devoted to studies focusing on relevance criteria used in the context of information seeking or retrieval. Thus, the present study will not review the ways in which different relevance criteria change as the information search process evolves (questions such as these have been discussed, for example, by </span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos67554"><span class="calibre3">Bruce, 1994</span></a><span class="calibre3">). Fourth, conceptualizations of temporal issues primarily discussed in the context of methodological and heuristic approaches were excluded. These approaches include, for example, Sense-Making Methodology and time-line interview method (</span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos78875"><span class="calibre3">Dervin, 1992</span></a><span class="calibre3"> and </span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos82630"><span class="calibre3">Dervin, 1999</span></a><span class="calibre3">), episodic interviewing (</span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos63119"><span class="calibre3">Bates, 2004</span></a><span class="calibre3">), and the think aloud method (</span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos91183"><span class="calibre3">Ericsson &amp; Simon, 1984</span></a><span class="calibre3">). Finally, the relationships between temporal factors and other contextual qualifiers of information seeking, for example, spatial factors were not reviewed.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre3">Even though the present study focuses on temporal factors as contextual qualifiers of information seeking, this should not be interpreted as an argument for their primacy over contextual factors at large. For example, spatial factors are equally important (the role of spatial issues of information seeking will be discussed in a separate study, see </span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos130994"><span class="calibre3">Savolainen, 2005</span></a><span class="calibre3">).</span></p><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_4"></div>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre21"><span class="calibre11">3. Approaches to the temporal context of information seeking</span></span></p><p class="calibre18"><span class="calibre3">In the present study, a number of approaches to temporal factors were identified. These approaches were ultimately classified into three major groups. First, time may be conceptualized as a fundamental attribute of situation or context of information seeking (Section 3.1). Because this approach thematizes temporal factors at an abstract level by discussing the nature of time horizons in information seeking in general, this viewpoint will be discussed first. Temporal factors can also be defined as qualifiers of access to information (Section 3.2). This approach is more concrete in that it addresses temporal factors as a scarce resource that tends to posit constraints to accessing information sources in specific contexts or situations. Third, temporal factors specify the information seeking as a process (Section 3.3). As the former approach thematizes, the extent to which time available affords the selection of information sources, the latter viewpoint directs attention to the order in which information sources are consulted, given this affordance.</span></p><p class="calibre10"><span class="calibre21"><span class="calibre11">3.1. Temporal factors as attributes of situation and context</span></span></p><p class="calibre18"><span class="calibre3">Temporal issues are inextricably linked with the questions of how to define the concepts of situation and context. Drawing on an extensive review of various approaches to situation and discussing the conceptual relationships between situation and context </span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos76109"><span class="calibre3">Cool (2001, p. 7)</span></a><span class="calibre3"> conclude that the terminology in this field varies to some extent, and there is a number of definitions. However, there seems to be no consensus on the concept of situation, even though temporal factors are constitutive of it in most definitions.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre3">In general, the concept of situation refers to combinations of people, places, and events. Alternatively, situation may be seen as the moment in time space as perceived by the respondent. According to </span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos120955"><span class="calibre3">McCreadie and Rice (1999, p. 59)</span></a><span class="calibre3">, situation stands for the particular set of circumstances from which a need for information arises, along with the awareness, however vague, that information may be useful in addressing the situation. </span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos133888"><span class="calibre3">Sonnenwald (1999)</span></a><span class="calibre3"> perceives information seeking as an activity that is located in specific contexts, situations, and social networks. Context is referred to as “the quintessence of a set (or group) of past, present and future situations” (p. 178). She also proposes that contexts are multi-dimensional in that they can be described by a variety of attributes such as place, time, goals, tasks, systems, situations, processes, organizations, and types of participants (p. 179). In turn, situation is defined as “a set of related activities, or a set of related stories that occur over time” (p. 180). Similarly, </span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos109180"><span class="calibre3">Kari and Savolainen (2003)</span></a><span class="calibre3"> advocate a temporally sensitive contextualist approach to information seeking by departing from the assumption that human life is conceptualized as a process that is characterized by “moving,” changing, and evolving through time and space—from a past to a present, and from a present to a future.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos80688"><span class="calibre3">Dervin (1997, pp. 14–15)</span></a><span class="calibre3"> criticizes the schematic, simplifying, and essentializing conceptions of context (cf. </span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos138485"><span class="calibre3">Talja, Keso, &amp; Pietiläinen, 1999</span></a><span class="calibre3">). Typically, they seem to be based on the assumption that context is a kind of a time-space “container” where phenomena reside and activities take place, constrained by the boundaries of the context. </span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos80688"><span class="calibre3">Dervin (1997, pp. 17–20)</span></a><span class="calibre3"> suggests an alternative approach to the issues of context by maintaining that reality is discontinuous, gap filled, and changeable across time space, and it is accessible only – and always incompletely – in context, in specific historicized moments in time space, and in spatial and temporal confluence of people, settings, activities, and events. Thus, the context of information seeking is something that changes over time; due to temporality, context is emergent and fluid. Ultimately, temporal factors become real as constitutive elements of contexts only through human practices.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre3">Temporal factors of information seeking may also be conceptualized in more concrete terms, for example, by characterizing the contexts of everyday life information seeking. One of the relevant conceptualizations in this field is “small world.” In a study characterizing the information world of low-skilled workers, </span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos73420"><span class="calibre3">Chatman (1991)</span></a><span class="calibre3"> examined the information needs and seeking behavior of female janitors at a university. It appeared that they had a narrow, concrete, and local view of the world, restricted to the most familiar social milieu that may be called a “small world”. In this world, the time horizon is restricted to the immediate present; it is felt that investments in the future are not viable because recurring disappointments are more probable than experiences of success. In particular, the expectation of what the future will bring affects the beliefs concerning the viability of investing in the future. If, for example, unemployed people repeatedly face difficulties in getting a new job, the sense of fatalism and feelings of helplessness, alienation, and depression will gain strength, also affecting information seeking. This means that only the most easily accessible and familiar sources in accord with the principle of the least effort will be preferred. Hence, limited time horizons in everyday life tend to restrict information seeking too.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre3">A related example of studies discussing the connection between information needs and future time perspectives is provided by </span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos88805"><span class="calibre3">Edwards and Poston-Anderson (1996)</span></a><span class="calibre3">; their study focused adolescent girls having concerns about education and jobs. The study showed that many of the informants deferred more detailed information seeking because they felt that it was still too early to try it. As in Chatman's “small world”, the limited time horizons of everyday activities may severely restrict information seeking in that they discourage the consultation of a broader repertoire of information sources.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre3">Further clarification to the role of everyday life time horizons as a context of information seeking is provided by </span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos103780"><span class="calibre3">Hektor (2001, p. 70)</span></a><span class="calibre3">. He draws on </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">time geography</span></span><span class="calibre3">—a concept developed by Torsten Hägerstrand. This concept suggests that everyday life can be conceived of as an unbroken sequence of activities where each activity is related to the circumstances of some project. Importantly, everyday life consists of many different projects with varying temporal perspectives. According to Hägerstrand (quoted in Hektor, ibid., p. 74), projects imply a blueprint for a specific future.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre3">There are different kinds of projects, generic and specific. </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">Generic projects</span></span><span class="calibre3">, for example, household care, are common to all people, while </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">specific projects</span></span><span class="calibre3"> are peculiar to one individual or a subcommunity. It is characteristic of specific projects that they also form a specific temporal context for everyday life information seeking because they are found in particular life situations or carry some special interest. Specific projects may appear in different forms, for example, as </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">change projects</span></span><span class="calibre3"> dealing with managing transitions in life, for example, moving from a rural village to a major city to get a new job. On the other hand, specific projects may manifest themselves as </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">pursuit projects</span></span><span class="calibre3"> that are less dependent on immediate needs (</span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos103780"><span class="calibre3">Hektor, 2001</span></a><span class="calibre3">, p. 76). These projects are continually present, furthering a general interest, for instance, a hobby. It is characteristic of pursuit projects that opportunities are acted upon where valued information is encountered. Change projects require a certain level of attention to the activities and they are probably often related to conscious strategies, while pursuit projects tend to be related to minimally conscious practices in the doings of everyday life.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre3">Interestingly, the above project types have similarities with </span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos145174"><span class="calibre3">Wilson's (1977)</span></a><span class="calibre3"> conceptions of interest, concern, and caring. According to Wilson (pp. 41–45), the category of </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">interest</span></span><span class="calibre3"> refers to a general level orientation towards some issue within an unspecific period of time. Like Hektor's pursuit projects, interest may manifest itself simply as wanting to know how things are in some areas. Interest may be passive or active. In the former case, information is received if it happens to become available. If interest is active, a person is inclined to find out more about a topic. The person may be interested in this topic, and occasionally he or she may, for example, read newspaper articles discussing about it. Because this topic is not seen to be of personal concern, the person may not make further attempts to seek information about it. However, in the opposite case, his or her interest turns into </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">concern</span></span><span class="calibre3">—a category coming close to Hektor's change project.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre3">Concern implies one's readiness to act, to exert control or influence. Like an interest, a concern may be passive, or as </span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos145174"><span class="calibre3">Wilson (1977, p. 44)</span></a><span class="calibre3"> says “closed,” not necessarily causing a person to seek information. In the case of active concern, a person tries to find more information to make sense of the situation or solve a problem. If some problem requiring immediate attention is identified, for example, a serious illness is identified, the concern turns into </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre3">caring</span></span><span class="calibre3">. Caring is a temporally sensitive context of information seeking in that the person engages in action in order to change or control the worrisome matters. He or she tries to acquire information systematically about these things. If they are felt to be less acute or painful, caring may gradually turn into concern or interest. At the same time, the role of seeking orienting information occupies a more central position compared to acquiring problem-specific information (cf. </span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos128650"><span class="calibre3">Savolainen, 1995</span></a><span class="calibre3">).</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre3">As the above conceptualizations indicate, temporal contexts suggest various kinds of “orders” of monitoring information sources bound to the routines of everyday life (</span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos103780"><span class="calibre3">Hektor, 2001</span></a><span class="calibre3">, pp. 159–163). For example, a person may have deeply ingrained habits or routines such as reading a newspaper in the morning or watching TV news in the evening (</span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos128650"><span class="calibre3">Savolainen, 1995</span></a><span class="calibre3">). In a way, everyday information-seeking habits located in specific temporal contexts serve the needs of maintaining a kind of “ontological security”, that is, the experience that certain things may be controlled from day to day (cf. </span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos101683"><span class="calibre3">Giddens, 1984</span></a><span class="calibre3">). In itself, “monitoring” of everyday events through media always implies some time horizon because monitoring may be focused both on the immediate past, the present and the immediate future, as exemplified by most people's interest in watching weather forecasts on television. On the other hand, monitoring may also be incidental. This kind of monitoring is closely related to information encountering (</span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos91887"><span class="calibre3">Erdelez, 1997</span></a><span class="calibre3">).</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre3">Even though the temporal context of information seeking often results in the reproduction of a person's rhythms of living from day to day – particularly due to mass media habits – temporal factors may also be produced in broader social settings.

Pettigrew discussed this kind of context of information seeking by focusing on specific populations, for example, people using the services of chiropodists at foot clinics. The major proposition concerning information grounds with regard to temporal factors is that information grounds can occur anywhere, in any type of temporal setting, and that they are predicated on the presence of individuals (</span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos98313"><span class="calibre3">Fisher et al., 2005</span></a><span class="calibre3">).</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre3">For example, a study focusing on the senior customers of a foot clinic revealed that it could be best described as an information ground, that is, an environment temporarily created by the behavior of nurses and customers having come together to perform a given task (</span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos126278"><span class="calibre3">Pettigrew, 1999</span></a><span class="calibre3">, p. 811). From this emerges a social atmosphere that fosters the spontaneous and serendipitous sharing of information. Interestingly, Pettigrew (p. 812) maintains that the clinic as an information ground disappears until the next scheduled gathering. Thus, seen from the temporal perspective, information ground is a virtual context of information seeking. This approach also concretizes </span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos80688"><span class="calibre3">Dervin's (1997)</span></a><span class="calibre3"> ideas discussed above by showing that ultimately, temporal factors constitutive of context are produced by mundane practices.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre3">To summarize, studies approaching temporal factors as fundamental qualifiers of situation or context of information seeking suggest that these situations and contexts are dynamic, fluid, and sometimes even virtual. The temporality of situations and contexts may also manifest itself in everyday life projects of varying length. The temporal context of information seeking is affected by social and cultural factors, as the concept of the “small world” indicates. Social contexts such as these may affect the ways in which individuals form their time horizons, and in turn these horizons may restrict information-seeking practices; naturally, there may be social contexts encouraging people to adopt broader time horizons and thereby enriching information seeking. Even though temporality makes situations and contexts of information seeking subject to continuous change, temporal factors may also be perceived from the viewpoint of reproducing information-seeking practices as habits. They stand for reiterative activities serving the needs of the “ontological security” of daily living, suggesting that temporal contexts of information seeking may also incorporate recurrent features.</span></p><p class="calibre10"><span class="calibre21"><span class="calibre11">3.2. Temporal factors as qualifiers of access to information</span></span></p><p class="calibre18"><span class="calibre3">Temporal factors are significant contextual qualifiers of information seeking in that they usually posit a major constraint to accessing information sources; in most cases, time is a scarce resource for information seekers. Hence, the time available for information seeking usually permits people to access and use only a limited set of information sources and channels. Temporal constraints may be objective; for example, determined by an absolute deadline set for the completion of a work task. </span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos77871"><span class="calibre3">Davies and McKenzie (2004)</span></a><span class="calibre3"> provide another example of temporal factors of these kinds in a midwifery setting in Ontario, Canada: there is a standard timeline for regular prenatal visits including discussion about check-list topics, thus to a large extent determining the times when information seeking and communication between prenatal care providers and clients may occur. Usually, in everyday contexts, the temporal constraints of information seeking tend to be less clearly defined and they are constructed subjectively.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre3">The time pressures may vary, depending on how quickly information is needed: a few minutes, hours, weeks, or months (</span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos70434"><span class="calibre3">Case, 2002</span></a><span class="calibre3">, p. 35). The time pressure and required degree of thoroughness faced by the seekers of information may vary considerably, depending on the problem or task at hand. In work-related problems, one may need basic facts immediately. In hobby-related issues – or in the pursuit projects referred to above – there may be no identifiable time pressure at all. Further, the time frames of information seeking may be experienced differently particularly in cases where information seekers face problems of information overload. Ultimately, the experiences of overload seem to be based on the judgment that there is too much potentially useful information to be accessed within too short a period of time (see, for example, </span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos86456"><span class="calibre3">Edmunds &amp; Morris, 2000</span></a><span class="calibre3">).</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre3">Unfortunately, we lack conclusive empirical studies of the significance of the time affordance, that is, the ways in which time pressures affect source preferences and perceptions of source accessibility. Since the 1960s—depending on study populations and research setting—there is somewhat conflicting evidence of the importance of source accessibility versus perceived quality as factors affecting source selection and use (see </span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos119057"><span class="calibre3">Marton &amp; Coo, 2002</span></a><span class="calibre3">).

These factors included identified “time and effort needed to approach, contact, or locate the source” and “ease of getting desired information from the source”. The study showed that clearly, for both attributes of accessibility—that is, time and effort, and getting information—the information sources that are perceived to closest at hand were considered to be most accessible. Surprisingly, however, time and effort to contact the source did not influence source usage. On the other hand, there was a strong connection between source quality and source usage (p. 149); this finding runs counter to </span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos102384"><span class="calibre3">Hardy's (1982)</span></a><span class="calibre3"> assumptions that information seekers primarily select sources based on their accessibility.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre3">A third example is provided about the information seeking of newspaper journalists. </span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos69686"><span class="calibre3">Byström (1999, p. 51)</span></a><span class="calibre3"> found that if they worked in a hurry, general-purpose sources such as experts and articles available in the local newspaper archive were avoided, and instead task-oriented sources such as the people concerned were favored. In similar situations, another group of participants, that is, municipal officials, tended to cut down the number of sources used. Further support for the above findings may be obtained from studies on the environmental scanning of managers (</span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos75370"><span class="calibre3">Choo, 2002</span></a><span class="calibre3">). When managers scan their environments in cases where time pressure becomes more severe, the “space” or “environment” of information seeking tends to become narrower. However, as evidenced by </span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos102384"><span class="calibre3">Hardy's (1982)</span></a><span class="calibre3"> and </span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos119057"><span class="calibre3">Marton and Coo's (2002)</span></a><span class="calibre3"> findings, it is difficult to generalize the ways in which information seekers weigh the benefits derived from quicker (and probably more superficial) information seeking against the risks of receiving low-quality information.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre3">The role of temporal factors as qualifiers of accessibility can be further specified by reviewing the findings of </span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos93705"><span class="calibre3">Fidel and Green (2004)</span></a><span class="calibre3">. Engineers were asked to articulate in their own words the factors that affected their choice of information. The study revealed no less that 12 various factors associated with accessibility (pp. 570–571). One of these factors is “saves time”; this was seen as a factor in that certain sources were believed to be able to access and obtain information quickly. When engineers selected a source that would save them time, they meant to reduce both their effort and the time spent on information retrieval.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre3">One factor indicating the close relationship between temporal and spatial factors was defined by referring to it as “is physically close”: the source was located in the immediate work area of the respondent so it was quickly and easily obtained. For example, the Web could easily be used because it was available on the desktop. Similarly, aspects particularly relevant to the temporal issues included “is available”. This means that a particular source was available at a particular time while others were not. The aspect of “is not busy” is also relevant from the temporal viewpoint. This aspect may be partly self-explanatory: engineers may prefer colleagues who are not otherwise occupied. There is an aspect of ease in this approach, as well as an element of time to be taken into consideration. Of the above factors, “sources I know” was mentioned most frequently (25% of all mentions), followed by “saves time” (19%), and “is physically close” (11%) (p. 572).</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre3">Time pressures may also affect everyday life information seeking, as indicated by </span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos106868"><span class="calibre3">Julien and Michels (2004)</span></a><span class="calibre3">. On the one hand, time pressure may lead to a less selective approach in evaluating information. However, the reverse may be similarly true; if there is a lack of time, only a few sources may be taken for closer consideration (p. 552). On the other hand, information needs may be differentiated within a broader perspective, for example, information needed today, within a few weeks, and no set time within which the information is needed. Moreover, in situations with open or undetermined time limits, an information seeker tends on average to use more sources than in other time frames. This may simply be due to the longer time available for searching (pp. 555–556). It also emerged that in situations with tight time frames, most of the sources chosen were not useful. This may suggest haste on the part of the seeker, leading to poor discernment. On the other hand, in undetermined time frames, the information seeker may not feel as motivated to be discerning because he or she has time to check a lot of sources.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre3">These findings imply that the constraining role of temporal factors is not clear-cut, if they are reviewed in connection to relevance judgments. More generally, this suggests that temporal factors of information seeking become more interesting if they are not reviewed separately but in relation to other contextual factors such as physical distance to information sources and their perceived usefulness. It is also evident that in temporally sensitive contexts, the concept of “enough” is relevant because it implies how much time one may devote to information seeking, particularly in hectic situations. Thus, concepts such as “satisficing” and “stopping criteria” are also temporally sensitive, suggesting that they are ultimately defined on the basis of time constraints of action (</span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos146820"><span class="calibre3">Zach, 2005</span></a><span class="calibre3">, p. 25). Naturally, the above concepts are also extremely interesting from the viewpoint of developing tools to fight information overload.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre3">Summing up: Because time tends to be a scarce resource, temporal factors of information seeking are often approached from the angle of objective and subjective constraints reducing an individual's chances to access and use information. In this light, it is no wonder that lack of time is seen as one of the most frequent barriers in information seeking. Even though there are no conclusive findings on the exact ways in which time pressures influence the perceptions of accessibility, time available for information seeking significantly affects it, as evidenced by the studies reviewed above. Temporal issues may also be actualized in the context of information overload, when too much information has to be interpreted within too narrow a time frame. However, we may think that in some cases, time pressure may have beneficial consequences because it compels the information seeker to make compromises by concentrating on a few sources that may provide “good enough” answers to his or her questions.</span></p><p class="calibre10"><span class="calibre21"><span class="calibre11">3.3.

In the next phase, the information seeker considers and identifies sources and channels that are expected to provide useful information to meet the information need. The information seeker then makes attempts to access the selected information sources and judges the relevance of information extracted from these sources. In the final stage of the process, information seeking overlaps with information use when information extracted from information source(s) is interpreted. The interpretation may result in judgments of two kinds: (i) the information need has been met sufficiently and information-seeking process may be stopped, or (ii) the information need has not been met or it is met partially. The latter judgment gives rise to a new or modified information need, and the information-seeking process may continue.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre3">The schematic model is used to illustrate that information seeking may be approached as a time-bound process; however, the major models of information seeking seldom elaborate the role of the temporal factors. This may be because the temporality of information seeking is taken as a self-evident point of departure, given the apparent assumption that all human action is embedded in time. Thus, in most models of information seeking, temporal factors are implicit, as exemplified by the “berrypicking” model developed by </span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos65423"><span class="calibre3">Bates (1989)</span></a><span class="calibre3">. In this model, the sequences of picking different sources suggest that the search process proceeds bit-at-a-time and that it may constrained by factors such as lack of time.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre3">Some of the models already developed in the 1970s brought novel aspects to temporal issues by explicating feedback loops running from the outcome of information seeking to information needs or other factors triggering information seeking. One of the earliest examples is provided by the conceptual framework for information behavior developed by </span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos92851"><span class="calibre3">Feinman, Mick, Saalberg, and Thompson (1976)</span></a><span class="calibre3">. The framework includes a feedback loop from the results of information seeking to work tasks generating information needs. Interestingly, Feinman et al. (p. 8) explicitly referred to time as a factor of information seeking by defining it as “the length of time the individual is willing to maintain the behavior before obtaining information”. Unfortunately, Feinman et al. did not specify whether the feedback loop means that information seeking is approached as a state which is sustained until something triggers a change to another state, or rather as a series of actions with beginnings and endings inherent in the action itself. This is due to that in the above model “information-seeking behavior” is defined very generally as “specific actions performed by an individual that are specifically aimed at satisfying information needs” (p. 3). It should be noted that questions such as these have remained unreflected also in later models emphasizing the importance of non-linear and reiterative features of information seeking (see, for example, </span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos99525"><span class="calibre3">Foster, 2004</span></a><span class="calibre3"> and </span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos125466"><span class="calibre3">Meho &amp; Tibbo, 2003</span></a><span class="calibre3">).</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre3">Importantly, </span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos92851"><span class="calibre3">Feinman et al.

Recently, the picture of the temporal factors has been complicated by the fact that alternatives are offered to the models where information seeking is understood by referring to sequential stages, as exemplified by </span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos111048"><span class="calibre3">Kuhlthau's (1993)</span></a><span class="calibre3"> Information Search Process model.

Instead, information seeking is cumulative, reiterative, holistic, and context bound and characteristic of it are concurrent, continuous, cumulative, and looped cycles occurring throughout the research project of the interdisciplinary researchers. In fact, the same idea was advocated some years earlier by </span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos131653"><span class="calibre3">Solomon (1997, p. 1098)</span></a><span class="calibre3">. His empirical study revealed that information behavior seldom follows the idealized order of selecting sources, gathering information, processing gathered information, assimilating or rejecting gathered information, processing gathered information, and fitting information into some task or decision situation. This means that information seeking may be better characterized by expressions such as non-linear, cycling, recycling, and false starts.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre3">Temporal factors also qualify the information-seeking process at a more general level because these factors may refer to the preference order in which people access different information sources and channels. Unfortunately, we lack empirical studies showing how people prioritize information sources in real life situations. However, temporal factors affecting the selection process can be illuminated by studying the order in which people would access information sources if they were to experience a specific kind of information need in the future. </span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos71158"><span class="calibre3">Case, Johnson, Andrews, Allard, and Kelly (2004)</span></a><span class="calibre3"> provide recent empirical findings on these issues in the field of seeking genetics information. The study participants were most likely first to turn to the Internet for information about genetics, disease, and testing, second to a medical doctor, third to a public library, and fourth to a family member (pp. 663–664). Other sources, such as hospital programs and county health officials, were seldom thought as first choices.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre3">It is apparent that pioneering studies such as these may be enhanced by reviewing the temporal qualifiers, that is, perceived preference order together with other contextual factors, for example, people's conceptions about the accessibility of the alternative sources and their perceived usefulness. Another issue that is intriguing from the viewpoint of temporal factors is the way in which people create information “pathways” by sequential selection of information sources. Drawing on the above empirical data, </span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos104496"><span class="calibre3">Johnson, Case, Andrews, Allard, and Johnson (2006, pp. 576–578)</span></a><span class="calibre3"> provide insightful findings concerning these pathways. They may manifest themselves as one-step patterns such as accessing information available from a doctor only or two-step patterns such as first a doctor, then the Internet. Naturally, the pathways may be longer, consisting of three, four, or even more steps, depending on the number of information sources deemed to be relevant in the information-seeking process.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre3">So far, the focus of information-seeking research has generally been on information needs experienced in the near past or at the moment (see, for example, </span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos74661"><span class="calibre3">Chen &amp; Hernon, 1982</span></a><span class="calibre3"> and </span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos116784"><span class="calibre3">Marcella &amp; Baxter, 1999</span></a><span class="calibre3">). Interestingly, </span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos68779"><span class="calibre3">Bruce (2005)</span></a><span class="calibre3"> provides a novel viewpoint by suggesting that information-seeking behavior is also effected by future tasks and anticipated needs, The number of empirical studies focusing on predicted future information needs is still low (see, however, </span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos116784"><span class="calibre3">Marcella &amp; Baxter, 1999</span></a><span class="calibre3">, pp. 169–172). This may be due in part to the necessarily speculative nature of such predictions. Bruce discusses the temporal dimensions of information needs and seeking in the context or organizing personal information collections. One may encounter situations where present and future (anticipated) information needs have to compromised in some way. Thus, there may be a tension between the management of information for the current task and the management of the information of potential value to future tasks. On the other hand, personal, anticipated information need assigns value to an information source or channel at a particular point in time. As Bruce suggests, this value may change as the individual moves forward with his or her life. Hence, there is always a risk that anticipated applications, tasks, decisions, or interest levels may not eventuate and that an anticipated need may simply not occur.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre3">The above findings imply that information needs and seeking may be reviewed from a broader temporal perspective. Even though information needs are experienced at a specific moment in time and similarly, information-seeking processes are tied to a specific moment, both information needs and seeking also have past and future dimensions. For example, </span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos85756"><span class="calibre3">Durrance (1984, p. 123)</span></a><span class="calibre3"> found that only a few of the problems or issues previously encountered by citizen group leaders had been resolved when they were interviewed about their information needs. It also appeared that information seekers may bring together information on the topic or issue for several years. Information needs may “last long” and they have a history of several months or even years, having an effect on the ways in which people seek orienting and problem-related information. More recently, </span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos91887"><span class="calibre3">Erdelez (1997, p. 417)</span></a><span class="calibre3"> has demonstrated that information encountering enables people to function in different time dimensions, that is, present, past, and future problems or information needs. This supports the view that information seeking may serve past, previous, present, and future needs, and that same information may be useful in various contexts occurring at different times.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre3">To sum up, information-seeking models seldom discuss temporal factors explicitly. Usually they have been referred to by depicting feedback loops from the outcome of information seeking to information needs. Since the 1990s, increasing attention has been devoted to information seeking as a dynamic and cyclic process and the stage models of information seeking have been challenged. Naturally, this complicates the setting, and the non-linear models posit even more difficult questions of how to analyze the temporal factors empirically. Temporal factors have also been approached by focusing on the order in which people prefer to select or access information sources and channels. In addition, temporal factors have given new meanings in recent studies emphasizing the importance of anticipated (future) information needs in the context of personal information management. Recent conceptualizations also pay attention to the interplay between the past, present, and future dimensions of information needs and seeking. These approaches support the contextualist view that although information seeking always takes place at a specific moment of time, this process is also affected by past experiences and future expectations of using different sources and channels.</span></p><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_5"></div>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre21"><span class="calibre11">4. Discussion</span></span></p><p class="calibre18"><span class="calibre3">Even though temporal factors occupy a prominent position among the contextual qualifiers of information seeking, their conceptual nature has not so far been reflected in greater detail. This suggests that the exploration of temporal factors of information seeking is demanding both conceptually and empirically due to the ambiguous nature of time as an ubiquitous constituent and context of all human action. Like relevance and other fundamental factors of information studies, time has many faces and temporal factors of information seeking will be subject to new definitions and interpretations. The present study revealed three major approaches to the temporal context of information seeking: time as a fundamental attribute of situation or context, time as a qualifier of accessibility, and time as an indicator of the information-seeking process.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre3">On the most abstract level, time qualifies situations and contexts of information seeking by making them dynamic, fluid, and subject to continuous change. On the other hand, the temporality of situations and contexts may manifest itself in various kinds of everyday projects (for example, change projects and pursuit projects). Ultimately, these projects, like other temporally sensitive contexts of information seeking such as “small world” or “time horizon of everyday life”, are permeated by social and cultural factors. Significantly, information seeking also incorporates habitual elements. Temporal factors may manifest themselves in the daily cycles of information seeking, as evidenced by deeply ingrained media habits. It is also obvious that temporality of situations and contexts of information seeking becomes a more interesting subject of research when temporal factors are reviewed in relation to other contextual factors, for example, the complexity of the work task at hand.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre3">On the other hand, temporal factors can be approached in terms of time affordance: time available permits people to access and use information to some extent. This means that time available necessarily constrains information seeking. Temporal constraints may be approached objectively or subjectively. The former refer to absolute deadlines of action measured in hours or days, while the latter stand for the ways in which people perceive such constraints. Interestingly, most studies on accessibility devote major attention to the latter issues; this evidences the popularity of the user-centered approach to information seeking. In these studies, temporal factors are not primarily seen as externally posed objective constraints that compel information seekers to behave in a certain way across situations. Rather, the ways in which temporal factors constrain information seeking, for example, with regard to its urgency, are approached in terms of subjective perceptions, however, by taking into account social factors such as role expectations and norms characteristic of a work team.</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre3">Finally, temporal factors have to taken necessarily into account when making information seeking understandable as a process. As cyclic and non-linear models challenge the stage models, they suggest novel viewpoints on temporal factors of information seeking. In itself, the coming of non-linear and cyclic models emphasizes the contingency of information-seeking processes. In addition, temporal factors are constitutive in the construction of the order in which information sources and channels are accessed. Seen from the broadest viewpoint, the dimensions of past, present, and future are embedded in the experiences and perceptions of information needs and seeking.</span></p><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_6"></div>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre21"><span class="calibre11">5. Conclusion</span></span></p><p class="calibre18"><span class="calibre3">One of the greatest methodological challenges for empirical studies is to explore the context of information seeking as a temporally sensitive process. In fact, this challenge was already identified 20 years ago by </span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos84963"><span class="calibre3">Dervin and Nilan (1986)</span></a><span class="calibre3">. In their call for a user-centered approach, they maintained that it is not sufficient to describe information seeking like taking a “still photo”. It should be captured as a “video”, as a “moving” occasion in time space. Similar challenges may be faced in studies exploring how the contexts of information seeking such as “information grounds” are created and sustained, and what causes them to disappear or transform (cf. </span><a></a><a href="Time_as_a_context_of_informatio_split_008.html#filepos98313"><span class="calibre3">Fisher et al., 2005</span></a><span class="calibre3">).</span></p><p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre3">The findings of the present study suggest that there is a need to develop a research agenda in order to approach the temporal issues of information seeking more systematically. First, there is a need for conceptual studies clarifying the nature of temporal or more broadly: spatiotemporal factors as contextual qualifiers of information seeking. Studies of these kinds may draw on the conceptualizations developed (e.g., in philosophy and psychology, and in studies on time geography and time affordance). Second, more specific attention should be paid to empirical questions dealing with temporal qualifiers in relation to other individual and contextual factors. Examples of intriguing research questions include how people's perceptions of time available for task performance or problem-solving affect their source preferences and relevance judgments in job-related and non-work contexts, how people's time horizons are related to their strategies to cope with the information overload, and how realistically people are able to anticipate their future information needs. Naturally, the list of research questions may be specified further by focusing on various groups of information seekers making use of information resources of different types. Focusing on questions such as there is worth trying since in this way novel viewpoints may be opened up on the contingencies of information seeking and use.</span></p><div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_7"></div>
